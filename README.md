# ScreenReader

have pyautogui, pytesseract, openai packages installed
and with will only work for windows for now, but for mac, remove line 9 and use a diffrent package instead of pyautogui

and create a file ending with `.env`
and add this in `key=PUT_YOUR_OPENAI_KEY_HERE` and replace `PUT_YOUR_OPENAI_KEY_HERE` when ur open AI key.
start the file, and it will read ur main monitor, and explain u with ocr
